#### Object Oriented Lab Programming Lab Question Assignment
##### Quesitions:
* Write a C++ program to find the no of vowels present in the given character array using pointer arithmetic.
* Write a C++ program to print the given no in reverse order. Use function with return type and without return type for reversing the number. For example, given no is 12345, output should be 54321
* Write a C++ program to perform various arithmetic ops such as add, sub, div,mod,and mult using inline function.
* Create a class for counting the no of objects created and destroyed within various block using constructor/destructor.
* Write a C++ program to create 3 objects for a class named pntr_obj with data members such as roll_no & name. Create a member function set_data(for setting the data values and print() member function to print which object has invoked it using 'this' pointer.
* Write a C++ program to to implement vitual function(polymorphism) by creating a base class c_polygon which has virtual function area(). Two classes c_rectangle and c_triangle derived from c_polygon and they have area() to calculate and return the area of triangle respectively.
* Write a C++ program to to count the no of persons inside a bank, by increasing count whenever a person enters a bank, using an increment(++) operator overloading function and decrease the count whenever a person leaves the bank using a decrement(--) operator oveloading fnction inside a class.
