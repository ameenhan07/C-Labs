TWO PROGRAMMES (P1.C AND P2.C) GENRATE STRINGS OF 5 CHARACTERS WHICH WILL CONTAIN ONLY ALPHABETS. THE STRINGS ARE THEN PASSED TO ANOTHER PROGRAMME (P3.C) WHICH WILL CALCULATE THE WEIGHT OF THE STRING AN. THE WEIGHT OF THE STRING IS THE SUM OF ASCII VALUE OF EACH CHARACTER .HOWEVER THE WEIGHT WILL BE MU,TIPLIED WITH 2 IF THERE IS A VOWEL IN THE STRING . THE PROGRAM P3.C THEN RETURNS THE STRING WHICH IS HAVING MORE WEIGHT TO BOTH THE PROGRAMMES WHICH THEN PRINTS THE STRING AND THEIR WEIGHTS. THE PROGRAM SHOULD WORK AS LONG AS THE USER WANTS TO WORK. USE SHARED MEMORY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM
